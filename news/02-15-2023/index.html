                    <p class="news">&emsp;Welp, we had a good run. This website has only been up for a day and a half and it is now banned at my trade school. When I came in this morning, I tried to show a few of my friend the improvments that I have made to this site only to be greeted by this message: "Oops, kaden.kemri.ch is not available because it is categorized as games." It really felt like the casual nature of the message was taunting me. I'm pretty sure this qualifies as bullying.<br>&emsp;Anyway, this is probably because an automated system saw that this website contains the subdirectory "/games/" and has a few embeds from scratch. The truth is, this site is not meant to host games. Yes, there are games on it, but those are only there to test my programing abilities, and the limits of html embeds. I'll probably talk to my teacher to see what I can do to get it unblocked. I am willing to remove my scratch embeds, however, I will absolutly not be removing the JavaScript games that I made.(not that they're any good)<br>&emsp;There's not much else to say on the topic so I'll just leave it at that. Stay tuned for future updates!</p>
