            <h1>About-Me</h3>
                
            <p>Hi. I'm Kaden Emrich.</p>
            <p>
                &emsp;I am a 17 year old from Ohio who is interested in computers. I have experience in html/css/javascript, PHP, SQL, Python, C#, C++ (to an extent), and Scratch. I have been exposed to Computer Science/I.T. for my whole life so I have quite a bit of knowledge in the area. My dream is to eventually go on to make games for a living but I'm still excited to be programming anything professionally because programming makes me happy. Studying at my trade school has helped me a lot so far. It has allowed me to win awards with BPA, and meet more like-minded individuals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Outside of school/career-dreams I have many other interests. Like most teenage boys nowadays, video games are my favorite pass-time. Games like Minecraft, Forza Horizon, Team Fortress 2, and Half-Life all had a great effect on me. I also try my best to program games in my free time, but, with a lack of ideas and stress from other things I don't work on them very often. I also have been playing guitar for longer than I can remember.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;I am the kind of person that will focus on whatever I am interested in at the time and will find it hard to devote my attention to other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;That's about all I have to say for now. Stay tuned for more stuff. I will probably continue to add to this site as time goes on.
            </p>
