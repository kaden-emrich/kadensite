            <p class="textBox"><span id="greeting">Hi. I'm Kaden Emrich.</span><br><br>&emsp;I am a 16 year old from Ohio who is intrested in both computers and music. I am currently studying Java at my local trade school, but, I also have experiance in html/css/javascript(obviously), Python, C++ to an extent, and Scratch. I have been exposed to Computer Science/I.T. for what feels like forever now so I have quite a bit of knowledge in the space. My dream is to eventualy go on to make games for a living but I'm still exited to be programing anything professionally. Studying at my trade school has helped me a lot so far. It has allowed me to win awards with BPA, and meet more like-minded indeviduals.<br><br>&emsp;Outside of school/career-dreams I have many other intrests. Clearly, video games are my favorate pass-time. Games like Team Fortress 2, Terraria, Rust, Forza, and Need for Speed are some of my favorites. I have always had a deep connection to music and have been playing guitar for longer than I can remember.(ask my mom, she'll know) I also try my best to program games in my free time, but, with a lack of motivation, ideas, and game-making-related skills, I don't do it very often. The only language that I actually feel confident in right now is Scratch. I have a lot to learn right now and I am trying to focus all of my effort on Java. But, I might still work in JavaScript more soon.<br><br>&emsp;I am the kind of person that will focus on whatever I am intrested in at the time and will find it hard to devote my attention to other things. However, if you ever want me to do something for you, a good mocha is a great motivator for me.<br><br>&emsp; That's about all I have to say for now. Stay tuned for more stuff. I will probably continue to add to this site as time goes on. Have a good one!</p>
