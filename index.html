                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi. I'm Kaden Emrich.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am a 17 year old from Ohio who is interested in computers. I have experience in html/css/javascript, PHP, SQL, Python, C#, C++ (to an extent), and Scratch. I have been exposed to Computer Science/I.T. for my whole life so I have quite a bit of knowledge in the area. My dream is to eventually go on to make games for a living but I'm still excited to be programming anything professionally because programming makes me happy. Studying at my trade school has helped me a lot so far. It has allowed me to win awards with BPA, and meet more like-minded individuals. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Outside of school/career-dreams I have many other interests. Like most teenage boys nowadays, video games are my favorite pass-time. Games like Minecraft, Forza Horizon, Team Fortress 2, and Half-Life all had a great effect on me. I also try my best to program games in my free time, but, with a lack of ideas and stress from other things I don't work on them very often. I also have been playing guitar for longer than I can remember.

    <div class="fullbox onebox" id="asteroids-area">

        <div class="glass-box dw70 mw90">
            <a href="https://asteroids.kadenemrich.com"><h3>Asteroids</h3></a>
            <p>Controls: Arrow Keys, W,A,S,D, Space</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Out of all of the programming projects that I have done so far, I’d say that Asteroids is probably my favorite. I’ve always liked Atari Asteroids because It’s a great example of a simple concept done well. So, I wanted to take a shot at it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The graphics in Asteroids are drawn with vectors on an html canvas to stay true to the original game. The game uses no outside engines or libraries. The collision, scoring, movement, etc. is all calculated by code written by me. Good thing I’ve always been good at math!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Many of the mechanics and values in the game went through countless revisions and tweaks. The logic for spawning more asteroids is one such mechanic that I am quite proud of. It feels like a natural progression especially if you don’t pay attention to the values that determine the spawning conditions.
                
                This game took a lot of time and effort so I would appreciate it if you play it. Hope you have fun!
